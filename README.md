The longest diagonals of a square matrix are defined as follows:
the first longest diagonal goes from the top left corner to the bottom right one;
the second longest diagonal goes from the top right corner to the bottom left one.
Given a square matrix, your task is to reverse the order of elements on both of its longest diagonals.
For

matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9]]
reverseOnDiagonals(matrix) = [[9, 2, 7],
                              [4, 5, 6],
                              [3, 8, 1]]
